# IMDB-Movie-Dashboard-Excel

As part of my learning from linkedIn learning regarding Excel dashboard I have prepared a dashboard based on the data set provided in the course.

Points to Note:

1) The data is provided by the course instructor in LinkedIn
2) The dashboard in it is prepared based on the guidance provided by the instructor during the course.

It was a nice learning experience on using pivot tables and pivot charts in excel and to come up with an interactive dashboard. This course has taught how to collect the data clean in power query and based on that build pivot tables and pivot charts and finally collecting all these tables and charts to come up with an interactive dashboard to help in making effective decision for the management.
